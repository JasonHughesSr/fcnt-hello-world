# FCNT Intro to Programming
This is the class repository for the Hello Workd: Introduction To Programming class taught at FCNT, a homeschool co-op in Texas.  Course assignments will take place through Replit.  This repository will be for artifacts and shared code.  This class is being tought by Jason Hughes.

# Sources: Learn Python the Right Way
Coursework is primarily inspired by the online (free) book called [Learn Python the Right Way](https://learnpythontherightway.com).
Learn Python the Right Way is a modern adaption of [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/).

## Intro 

**Learning Goals:**

1. Students will be able to learn in a no-setup environment so they can focus on code.
2. Students will be able to learn computer science fundamentals.
3. Students will be able to practice by building real-world projects.

**Expected Student Background:** 

Students are not expected to have any prior programming experience.

**Timing:**

We have 10 weeks in this class and aim to cover a broad range.  At the end of the class studends will have instructions on how they can take the full "Learn Python The Right Way" course as well as other continuing paths if they are interested.

## Approach

- Use the online IDE [Replit](https://replit.com/~) instead of showing students how to set up Python on Windows (a point where many aspiring programmers give up).
- Modernize the presentation and convert the source to Markdown so readers can more easily contribute.
- Use the online app PythonTutor.com for step-by-step visualisation and stepping through code.
- Students have a private replit team that they can submit assignments and discuss projects with their classmates.
